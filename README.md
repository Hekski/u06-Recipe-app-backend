# Frontend

School Assignment @ Chas Academy, spring 2022. This is the back end part of it. The assignment was to create a rudamentary recipe app that fetches recipes from an external API and that is also connected to a Laravel backend API that stores recipes in user lists on a database.

Project needs refinements:
  - Code clean up
  - Messeges and alerts from backend needs work
  - Deployment
  - This readMe and documentation
  - Probably other stuff...

## Getting started
